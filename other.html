    <h1>Words </h1>
    <p>My name rhymes with half a knee. I grew up in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Muscat, Nairobi, Toronto. When not doing physics,  I play
the guitar, question my existence and paint. I find myself in a state of an unknown feeling that words cannot explain and yet 
is the proof that I am alive. </p>
